# A-Trusted-Blockchain-Based-Traceability-System-for-fruit-and-vegetable-Agricultural-Products
📌 Overview

This project is a Trusted Blockchain-Based Traceability System designed to ensure transparency and security in the supply chain of fruits and vegetables.
It uses Blockchain to store and track transactions securely, preventing tampering or fraud.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Languages: Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL

Frameworks: JSP (JavaServer Pages), JDBC (for DB connectivity)

Tools: Netbeans 8.0.2, MySQL Workbench / XAMPP, GitHub

Server: Apache Tomcat

⚙️ Implementation

Frontend (JSP + HTML/CSS/JS):

User login, dashboard, add product, and trace product pages.

Backend (Java Servlets):

Handles requests (login, add product, trace product).

Interacts with database via DAO classes.

Database (MySQL):

Stores user info, product details, and blockchain transactions.

Blockchain Module (Custom Java Classes):

Block, Transaction, and Blockchain classes ensure data integrity.

Each product transaction is added as a new block.

Server (Tomcat):

Hosts the application and handles client requests.

⚡ How It Works

User Authentication: Farmers, retailers, and admins log in.

Add Product: Farmers add agricultural products with details.

Blockchain Entry: Each product transaction is recorded in the blockchain.

Trace Product: Retailers/consumers can trace the complete history of a product.

Security: Blockchain ensures that records cannot be altered or deleted.

🚀 Future Scope

Mobile App integration for easy access.

AI/ML for fraud detection and predictive analytics.

Cloud deployment (AWS/Azure) for scalability.

QR code generation for consumer product verification.

✅ Advantages

🔒 Data Security: Blockchain prevents tampering of records.

🌍 Transparency: Consumers can verify product history.

👨‍🌾 Trust: Builds trust between farmers, retailers, and consumers.

⚡ Efficiency: Reduces chances of fraud in supply chains.

⚠️ Limitations

🖥️ Requires internet connectivity for access.

💾 Storage grows as blockchain expands.

⚙️ Complex for non-technical users to understand.

⏳ Performance may slow with very large datasets.

📌 This project demonstrates how Blockchain + Web Technology can create a secure and transparent traceability system for agriculture.
